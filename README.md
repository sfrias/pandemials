Studying sewage for public health information is known as Wastewater-based epidemiology(WBE). Weâ€™re look at findings to stablish fast and better points for the sample collection without sewage system info.<BR>
Wastewater has biomarkers that indicate the health of the entire community, that was also proved with other diseases, as poliovirus.<BR>
Analyzing wastewater provides a way to understand community health in a manner that provides rapid and sensitive analysis of an entire community without conveying any personally identifiable information. Privacy and Confidentiality is granted at this level.
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 ARN fragments per liter of wastewater sampled in the wastewater accounts for a collective of individual samples that include both, diagnosed and undiagnosed cases in the community, performs as community-level viral biomarker flag, part of a set of tools to address important public health questions.<BR>
Can be useful to early detect areas with infected people, and address measures selectively, adopting and implementing better strategies.<BR>

This method, can also help in countries with more limited resources as a tool to do surveillance of the virus circulation on the population, where waste water system does not exist, or is uncontrolled, and streams were not disinfected.<BR>
The Waste water feeds along the slopes of natural route, more or less channeled, grouping into watersheds that was bound to specific polygonal area, which will converge in their natural collectors, and thus to the lowest level points.<BR>
For an area, identify the slopes, watersheds, and concentration areas, that are optimal to take samples just before fall into downstream or into a bigger watershed is not hard if you can process a Digital Elevation Model(DEM) for this area, and calculate low track and concentration areas, perhaps processing partial DEM model or DMT to calculate Topographic Position Index and identify paths
